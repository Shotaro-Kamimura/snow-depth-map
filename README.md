## Overview
This project visualizes snow depth observations from the current season,
showing regional distribution and time series changes across Japan.

## Why Snow Depth Matters

It directly affects daily life, infrastructure, economic activities such as ski resorts, land use, and risk.
By visualizing snow depth spatially, this project aims to make these invisible constraints visible.
